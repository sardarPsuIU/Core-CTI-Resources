This Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) Core Resource guide is meant to provide the professional development resources for CTI analysts. 

It is meant for more traditional intelligence analysts and junior/mid-level CTI analysts 

There are mutliple GITHUB pages for CTI Tools, this product is not meant to replace these, Tools are important for CTI analysis but this is meant for professional development for CTI analysts 

For another great REPO for CTI, with many tools to fill in the other gaps not addressed in this guide see https://github.com/hslatman/awesome-threat-intelligence 

A majority of the resources are based on Sergio Catalonie's Blog ActiveResponse, Rob Lees Dragos Reading List, and resource recommendations from across the CTI community by a variety of CTI Rockstars who are included in the Twitter Sheet

Thank you for the name idea from Katie Nickels @likethecoins and @chicagocyber

This is my first Git Repo so feedback is greatly appreciated
